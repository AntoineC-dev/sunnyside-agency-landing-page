## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

#### General feelings

This project was pretty much a CSS challenge. The only javascript is for the mobile menu.

I chose this one thinking "I am going to chill with a Junior Project" and let me say it: **It was not easy**.

Many hard choices especially with the images! I chose to add them in the markup instead of using the CSS background-image because it seems to me that they are as important as the rest of the content.

Also many absolute positioning.

#### HTML Picture tag

I had already worked with the srcset attribute of images but this time i was not happy with it because of the fact that on mobile device with a high dpi (3x or 4x) some images would switch to there desktop version breaking the layout.

I used the `<picture></picture>` tag instead which gives much more control over the breakpoints etc...

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 649px)" srcset="./src/assets/mobile/image-header.jpg" />
  <img class="header__image" srcset="./src/assets/desktop/image-header.jpg" alt="An orange sliced in half" />
</picture>
```

### Continued development

I am not really pleased with the current layout above 1440px. The images are not wide enough for this, so it gets really pixelated.

I can't really add a max-width to the whole thing tho it does not look like this type of layout.

If you think about a solution feel free to share! ðŸ˜„
